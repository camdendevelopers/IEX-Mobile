# IEX Mobile
IEX Mobile is an open source iOS application that allows you visualize your [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io) subscription data.

## Getting Started
IEX is a free iOS application that uses your own API tokens from IEX Cloud. You can get your IEX tokens for free by signing up [here](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/). All accounts get a publishable and private token that you can use on your own applications. 

## About IEX Mobile
IEX Mobile is a completely independent app only to be used as a reference to see what sort of data you can get from IEX Mobile and how it may be used within a native application. My work is completely independent from IEX Cloud, and I have not received any compensation or partnership from this app.

## Future Development
While building this application, I realized there was no Swift API wrapper around IEX Cloud REST services. I hope to be able to put all files used to call these services into their own framework so that other developers can use it for their network requests.
